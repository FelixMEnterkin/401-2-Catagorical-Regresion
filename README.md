# 401-2-Catagorical-Regresion
The repository contains the replication code for Soc 401-2 Categorical Regression Methods.

R code to replicate the analysis is broken down into three separate files. 1) Reads in the relevant data file, merges datasets together, and constructs the relevant variables for the analysis. 2) recreates the descriptive statistics used in the paper, and 3) includes the analysis used within the paper, re-creating the multinomial logit models. 

Data used within the paper are proprietary and therefore are not included within this replication package.
